"""Offboarding dashboard "Offboarding Pipeline" widget tests.

Regression coverage for a bug where the pipeline rendered one tile per
OffboardingStage *row* instead of one tile per stage *type* -- since every
Offboarding process/template seeds its own set of stage rows, having more
than one process in the company multiplied the tile count (e.g. 3 templates
x 6 stage types = 18 tiles, with the same stage label repeated per template).
