"""Give the demo Project catalog real spread across a trailing 6 months.

Only one real historical Project row ships in the fixtures. The other five,
in project_scenarios_data.json, are re-anchored by
`reanchor_project_scenarios` below rather than left untouched: their static
dates were authored one calendar year off, so the generic whole-file date
shift (`_shift_fixture_dates`) landed their Timesheet entries in the future
roughly as often as not, which a logged timesheet -- a record of work
already performed -- must never be.

One point can't populate a 6-month started/completed trend, so this also
creates a small, fixed set of additional projects -- idempotent via `title`
(globally unique on the model) -- and re-dates all of them fresh on every
run.
