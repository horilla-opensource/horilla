"""Spread demo EmployeeObjective dates across a real trailing 6 months.

Only 8 EmployeeObjective rows exist across the base + scenarios fixtures,
clustered around a single month roughly 10-14 months before any reasonable
"today" -- well outside a 6-month trailing window regardless of the anchor
shift. The PMS progress trend groups by `updated_at`, which is `auto_now=True`
-- a plain `.save()` always resets it to today, so this must go through
`.filter().update()` (which bypasses `auto_now`, same as normalize_demo_payslips).
