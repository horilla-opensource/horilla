"""Give every demo company its own Recruitment pipeline, not just the largest.

recruitment_data.json's 3 Recruitments, all their Candidates, and all their
Stages are 100% scoped to the largest demo company -- switching company
context anywhere in the Recruitment or Onboarding modules shows a
completely empty pipeline for the other two. This creates one open
Recruitment per additional company, with its own Stage set and a small
Candidate pool spread across a realistic status mix, reusing the existing
JobPosition catalog rather than inventing new lookup data. Each new
recruitment also gets its own minimal OnboardingStage pair and a completed
CandidateStage for its one hired candidate, since OnboardingStage is itself
per-recruitment (onboarding_trend.py only ever populated recruitment #1's).
