"""Give every demo company its own, genuinely scoped asset inventory.

AssetCategory/AssetLot ship with an empty company_id (the "visible to every
company" convention HorillaCompanyManager treats as shared), and Asset has
no company field of its own -- it only derives one transitively through
asset_category_id__company_id. Since every category is unscoped, all 200
demo Asset rows are visible under every company simultaneously: switching
company context never changes what asset inventory is shown.

Existing categories/assets are deliberately left untouched here rather than
re-scoped -- some are already referenced by AssetAssignment rows for
employees across all 3 companies, and narrowing an existing category to one
company would make those assets invisible under their own current holder's
company filter. Instead this adds one company-exclusive category per
additional company, with its own small, headcount-proportional asset pool.
