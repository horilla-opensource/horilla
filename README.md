> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`2.0` is now this repository’s default branch.** Use it to run or deploy Horilla (a plain `git clone` checks it out). To contribute code, branch from and open PRs against `dev/v2.0` — GitHub still pre-selects `2.0` as the PR base, so switch it manually. v1 (`1.0`/`master`) is deprioritized, with fixes considered case-by-case rather than on a guaranteed schedule. Full details → [Discussion #1127](https://github.com/horilla/horilla-hr/discussions/1127).

## 🌳 Which Branch Do I Want?

- **`2.0`** (default) — the latest stable v2 snapshot. This is what a plain `git clone` gives you. Use it to run or deploy Horilla.
- **`dev/v2.0`** — the active integration branch. If you want to contribute code, branch from and open PRs against this, not `2.0`.
- **`1.0`/`master`** — v1, now deprioritized (fixes considered case-by-case, no guaranteed schedule). Not deleted, but no longer where active development happens.

See [Discussion #1127](https://github.com/horilla/horilla-hr/discussions/1127) for full background on this transition.
