    """
    Gate an approve/reject endpoint: the caller must hold ``perm`` or manage the
    employee the record belongs to, and must never be that employee.

    Separate from ``manager_or_owner_permission_required`` because that one
    admits the owner, which is right for reading or editing your own request and
    exactly wrong for approving it. Approval needs the opposite: a second person.

    GHSA-gc35-jfv9-r3cm: the leave-allocation approval endpoint credited
    ``requested_days`` to the requester's balance behind
    ``manager_permission_required``, which asks only whether anybody reports to
    the caller. Any employee who managed one person could file an allocation for
    themselves with an arbitrary day count and approve it.

    Scoping the manager test is not on its own enough. Nothing stops an employee
    from being recorded as their own reporting manager, and in a small company a
    manager may legitimately manage everyone; either way a scoped check would
    still pass them for their own request. So the self-approval refusal is
    explicit and independent of the manager test.

    ``designated_approvers`` names the callers a record nominates for itself --
    a leave request built by a multiple-approval condition is approved by the
    managers on that condition, who need be neither the reporting manager nor a
    permission holder. Without it, scoping the manager test would lock those
    approvers out of the chain they exist to serve. It is consulted after the
    self-approval refusal, never before it.

    ``pk_kwarg`` is the URL keyword naming the record, for the handlers routed
    as something other than ``pk``.
