"""
Seed global (company-agnostic) default tours.

These ship enabled out of the box so a brand-new tenant gets guided onboarding
immediately — directly addressing the "empty system, no guidance" churn problem.
Tours are global (company_id=None) and therefore visible to every company;
admins can edit, unpublish or clone them from Settings → Product Tours.
