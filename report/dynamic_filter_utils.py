"""
Shared helpers for the dynamic Filters panel used across every report
(employee, asset, attendance, leave, payroll, pms, recruitment). Each
report's `_apply_dynamic_filter_row` duplicates its own field-path maps and
operator dispatch (they're independent, model-specific catalogs), but the
date-relative-range math is identical everywhere, so it lives here once.
